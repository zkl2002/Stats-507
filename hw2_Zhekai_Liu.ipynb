    "Your homework solutions should be written entirely in this Jupyter notebook file. Once it contains your solutions, you should submit this notebook through Canvas. Before submitting, please make sure make sure __Cells->Run__ executes without errors; errors in your code cause problems for our auto-grader. Thus, even though we may ask you to check for errors in your functions, you should not include in your submission any examples of your functions actually raising those errors.\n",

    "## Nbgrader\n",
    "\n",
    "We will be using `nbgrader` to grade your jupyter notebook. Additional tests will be used at grading time, you are encouraged to read the problem carefully and verify your code covers all appropriate cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Be careful:** If a jupyter notebook cell takes longer than `60s` to run, the autograder will not grade it and you will receive zero credit for that question.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Error checking\n",
    "\n",
    "You do not need to do error checking (raising errors, etc.) in your code unless we explicitly ask you to so in a problem. <b>In this homework, if there is an element is an incorrect type within a correct type, you can raise either a ValueError or a TypeError</b>. For example, if a question asks for a tuple of ints and the input tuple is `(2,2,'s')`, either error is acceptable.Note: The tests shown are not comprehensive, so you are encouraged to read the problem carefully and verify your code covers all possible cases.\n",
    "Homework tips\n",
    "Start early! If you run into trouble installing things or importing packages, it’s best to find those problems well in advance, not the night before your assignment is due when we cannot help you!\n",
    "\n",
    "Make sure you back up your work! At a minimum, do your work in a Dropbox folder. Better yet, use git, which is well worth your time and effort to learn.\n",
    "\n",
    "Be careful to follow directions! Remember that Python is case sensitive. If you are ask you to define a function called my_function and you define a function called My_Function, you will not receive full credit. You may want to copy-paste the function names below to make sure that the functions in your notebook match.\n",

Letting $n$ be the integer given in the input, your function should return a tuple of the same length as the input tuple, but with its entries “rotated” by n. If n is positive, this should mean to “push forward” all the entries of the input tuple by n entries, with entries that “go off the end” of the tuple being wrapped around to the beginning, so that the $i^{th}$ entry of the input tuple becomes the $(i + n)^{th}$ entry of the output, wrapping around to the beginning of the tuple if this index goes off the end. If n is negative, then this corresponds to rotating the entries in the other direction, with entries of the input tuple being “pushed backward”. Your function should perform error checking to ensure that the inputs are of appropriate types. If the user supplies a non-integer, print a message to alert the user that the input was not as expected, and try to recover by casting it to an integer. __Hint__: a try/catch statement will likely be useful here."
